### Tech Stack
The tech Stack I used was HTML and CSS. I used these 2 because i had some exposure to it during my co-op and also from the youtube videos given it seemed quite straightforward. I used github pages to deploy since it was easy to attach my main branch to it. I had gotten some assistance from ChatGPT to complete my HTML and CSS files as it was my first real time actually coding it so the assistance from that was valueable. 
### Why did I used MIT license?
A MIT license is simple to use and short to the point as per https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/ and it was easy to implement the license into my git repo.
